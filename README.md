# HealthTick Bookings

A modern healthcare appointment booking system built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## Live Demo

Check out the live application: [https://healthtick-bookings.vercel.app/](https://healthtick-bookings.vercel.app/)


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **UI Components:** MUI X (Material-UI Extended)
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Features

- Both onboarding and reccuring booking
- Logic to handle booking and client data (firestore)
- Good logic to handle overlaps and concurrency
- Accurate generation of daily slots

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandavarma/Healthtick-Bookings.git
   cd Healthtick-Bookings
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   ### (ðŸ”´)This is not required, as for assignment purposes I have setup the project directly without using any environment variables. Usually we don't do this in production.(ðŸ”´)

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)


## Assignment Context
- I've implemented everything with clear logic.
- I've used AI-tools for minimal logic and component generation with clear understanding of code and concept.
- I used MaterialUI only in some parts as they cannot be implemented with pure tailwindcss.
- I maintained file structure similar to industry standard applications. (Also suitable for scalable applications)
