- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **UI Components:** MUI X (Material-UI Extended)
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Features

- Both onboarding and reccuring booking
- Logic to handle booking and client data (firestore)
- Good logic to handle overlaps and concurrency
- Accurate generation of daily slots

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandavarma/Healthtick-Bookings.git
   cd Healthtick-Bookings
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   This is not required, as for assignment purposes I have setup the project directly without using any environment variables.

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Assignment Context
- I've implemented everything with clear logic.
- I've used AI-tools for minimal logic and component generation with clear understanding of code and concept.
- I used MaterialUI only in some parts as they cannot be implemented with pure tailwindcss.
- Thanks for the oppurtunity
